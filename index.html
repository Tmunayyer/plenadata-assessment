    <div>Assessment by: Thomas Munayyer</div>
    <div>Date: 09/04/2020</div>

    <br />

    <div>
        Prompt: Create an application that will prompt for a 
        user to input a string. Using the user’s inputted string, 
        find the first letter that is not repeated. For example: 
        If given the string ‘Bubble’, the letter ‘u’ would be the 
        first character returned from the program. Once the first 
        character is found and displayed back to the user, rewrite 
        the string in order of number of occurrences and order from 
        the inputted string. In the above example ‘Bubble’ would then 
        be rewritten as ‘uleBbb’. Display this to the user.
